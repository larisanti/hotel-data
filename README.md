## Project Steps

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning
- Imported the bookings dataset in CSV format.
- Used the `=TRIM()` formula to remove unnecessary whitespace from the columns `Hotel`, `Status`, and `Day`.
- Applied the `=LEFT()` function to standardize entries in the `Hotel` column.
- Reviewed the dataset for missing or suspicious data and made necessary adjustments.

### 2. Formatting and Sorting
- Created a table showing the monthly percentage of total reservations, categorized by hotel type and reservation status.
- Formatted percentages without decimal points for better readability.
- Sorted the data to provide a clear view of monthly trends and changes over time.

### 3. Data Protection and Presentation
- Developed a revenue calculation table to evaluate the financial impact of special requests and created a brief summary report.
- Enabled sheet protection to safeguard against accidental modifications.
- Hid the original `Bookings` sheet to streamline the file for presentation purposes.
