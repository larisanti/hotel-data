## Project Overview

Analysis of hotel reservations data focusing on cancellation rates and revenue from special charges. The focus is on assessing cancellation rates and revenue from special charges while ensuring that the data is accurate and well-prepared.


## Steps

### 1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
   - Imported the bookings CSV file.
   - Trimmed whitespace from the hotel, status, and day columns using the `=TRIM()` formula to ensure clean data.
   - Applied the `=LEFT()` function to standardize hotel data.
   - Checked for missing or suspicious data.

### 2. **FNumber Formatting and Sorting**
   - Formatted a table showing the monthly percentage of total reservations by hotel type and reservation status as percentages without decimal points.
   - Sorted the table for easier reading, allowing a clear view of changes over time.

### 3. **Data Protection and Presentation**
   - Created a revenue calculation table to assess the impact of special requests and present a brief report.
   - Protected the sheet to prevent accidental changes.
   - Hid the bookings sheet to tidy up the file for presentation.
